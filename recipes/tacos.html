<h2>Description</h2>    
<p>Birria, a.k.a. tacos de birria, is a Mexican dish of meat (usually goat or beef) stewed in its braising liquid until it reaches
        a melt-in-your-mouth texture. Traditionally, it gets its flavor from dried chile peppers. Birria can be served alone as a stew or on corn tortillas.
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Dried chile peppers</strong>: The flavorful birria starts with dried guajillo chile peppers, chile de arbol peppers, and ancho chiles.
            For a bit of extra heat, <strong>don't</strong> remove all the seeds.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Beef</strong>: Beef chuck roast is <em>perfect</em> for braising for hours. When you're done, the meat will shred incredibly easily.</li>
        <li><strong>Seasonings</strong>: You'll need salt, pepper, fresh garlic, whole cloves, cinnamon, cumin, thyme, marjoram, and oregano.</li>
        <li><strong>Olive oil</strong>: Sear the meat in olive oil before you add the braising liquid.</li>
        <li><strong>Tomatoes</strong>: Grill Roma tomatoes before blending them with other ingredients to unlock extra layers of flavor.</li>
        <li><strong>Vinegar</strong>: Two tablespoons of white vinegar adds even more acidity to the braising liquid.</li>
        <li><strong>Tortillas</strong>: Use store-bought or homemade corn tortillas.</li>
        <li><strong>Onion and cilantro</strong>: Finish each taco with chopped onions and fresh cilantro for a final punch of flavor and texture.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Preperation</h2>

        </li>
        <li>Season the beef and <em>sear on all sides</em> in oil in a Dutch oven.</li>
